# Bader_charge_analysis_QS
1. General code to analyse the ACF.dat file from post-processing bader charge analysis of Quantum Espresso
2. In order to use the code you need two files: 1) ACF.dat from ppx bader charge analysis in QS and 2) coordinate.in file where you only have the atomic coordinates of all the atoms in QS format (example: Cu ----- ----- ------)
3. You need to specify the index of surface atoms as a list in the code. 
4.
